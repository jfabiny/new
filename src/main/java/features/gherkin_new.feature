  Background:
    Given I login to KiSSFLow with the username "samosa@basy.cf" and password "Kissflow123"
	And I create an App "TestApp" 
	#you are allowed to change the name of the App alone if you found that an App Alrady exists with that name
    And I create a Field of type "Text" with Name "State" on "TestApp"
    And I create a Field of type "Text" with Name "Needs Verification" on "TestApp"
    And I add a Formula 'IF(State="TamilNadu","Yes","No")' to "Needs Verification" on "TestApp"
    And I published "TestApp"
  @tamilnadu  
  Scenario: If should fire when I enter "TamilNadu"
    When I Initiate "TestApp" as "item1"
    And I enter "TamilNadu" in "State" for "item1"
    Then field "Needs Verification" for "item1" should equal "Yes"

  @kerala
  Scenario: Else should fire when I enter "Kerala"
    When I Initiate "TestApp" as "item2"
    And I enter "Kerala" in "State" for "item2"
    Then field "Needs Verification" for "item2" should equal "No"
